physical table top

This project aims to create a program useful for displaying maps for RPGs on physical tabletops.  The name is a play on
"virtual table top" programs, which provide many more features than are necessary for merely showing a map on a coffee
table powered by a flatscreen TV or projector.

The feature list of ptt is as small a possible to promote ease-of-use.

1. Display layered objects, including images and fog-of-war
2. Ability to hide and reveal objects.
3. Separate but synchronized controller and viewer instances.
